# THIS REPOSITORY IS FORK.

This repository is fork of https://github.com/yewton/sudden-death.el,
but original repository has already been archived by its owner and
with that removed from MELPA.  Since I use this little el once in a
while, I forked the repository to keep my environment of emacs.

Thanks to all the contributors.
